# Getting feedback through GDPR

### Introduction

Historically, if a company didn't give feedback or test scores or whatever, there was little you could do. The GDPR changed it, but I have seen little documentation on how to actually use it to your advantage. This guide attempts to do so.

### The potential benefits

Suppose you got rejected from a company. What kind of information could you want?

* If you did an entrance exam, it would be nice to see what mark you got - because that gives a good indication on whether the failure was caused _because_ you did poorly in the exam - or whether it was something else.
* Also, it would be very useful to see if you could get the questions (and answers) you did in the test - as that would be valuable preparation material should you decide to apply again.
* Now suppose you did an interview, and the company did not respond, or refused to provide feedback. Clearly, they had _some_ notes on the interview, and it would be useful to get hold of them.

What could the GDPR do in these cases? Here are a few positive examples:

* [SIG](Application%20experiences/2021-22/SIG/Quantitative%20Trader%20-%202022%20Programme.md) provided a copy of the entrance exam, answers and statistical data on my performance, and some _amazing_ interview notes which I found very useful in understanding what went wrong.
* [Facebook](Application%20experiences/2021-22/Facebook/Software%20Engineer,%20University%20Grad.md) provided interview feedback (despite otherwise having a policy not to) - which was similarly very insightful.
* Goldman Sachs provided the pass mark for the HackerRank exam, and also implicitly provided valuable information into how their exams are scored

It's not perfect however:

* [Microsoft](Application%20experiences/2021-22/Microsoft/UK%20New%20Grad.md) claimed that I never interviewed with them (which was clearly false)
* DRW told that my entrance exam mark was not "personal information" (i.e, confidential) - which makes little sense but I'm not a lawyer

But from my experience, one's more likely to get useful information than not.

### Criteria

You must be applying for a role in the EU. It does _not_ matter if you are living outside the EU. What has not been tested however is applying for a role outside the EU as an EU resident and requesting GDPR on that non-EU role.

### The process

The first step is to find the right email address. This can _usually_ be found by going to a company's privacy policy page and looking at the EU GDPR section - specifically many companies have an email address that points to their DPO (data protection officer) or similar. You then need to send an email to them asking for your personal information - many of the links above included the templates I used when making use of GDPR. 

Then you need to wait. Legally they need to respond to your request within a month - but in practice I've had response times from one day to about 45 days. Some companies may also choose to call you. 

Finally, you'll usually get the data. I've had that given in many different ways - some will email/text you an access code - while others may use an internal "secure email" service which you may be asked to register. There'll also be some legalese, including what you got and what they withheld (which is usually things such as the names and the emails of the recruiters that worked on the application). The links above provide an indication of what you _could_ get.
