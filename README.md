# Online assessments and interviews
The guide to online assessments and interviews. This is not a RTM release and is still well in the beta range. Feedback and contributions are welcome and appreciated. 

This repository consists of two sections:

* A section giving useful guides into online assessments. I would also like to see guides for other sections such as interviews, but do not have sufficient experience to write one myself. Contribution from others would be greatly appreciated. 
* A section giving application experiences into various companies by year (as long as it was not a case of getting rejected after application with nothing else).

### Contributing

Please use GitHub issues to contribute to this repository, either by pull requests or by simply creating a new issue. For regular discussion, GitHub Discussion is also available.
