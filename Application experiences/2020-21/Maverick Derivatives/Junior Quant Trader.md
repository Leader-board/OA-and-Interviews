### IQ examination

This is automatic and happens immediately after application. It's a classic IQ test - 50 questions, 15 minutes and there is no option to skip and return back to questions. The test has mathematics, English (including vocabulary) and logical reasoning. 

### HackerRank examination

75 minutes, 4 questions. This contains two LeetCode Mediums, one LeetCode hard (DP) and another LeetCode hard (DP), the last one which I basically skipped since I was running out of time. While the HackerRank exam technically allowed any language, I was asked to code only in Python.

### Round 1 interviews

This was with (recruiter). Bear in mind - this person may be HR, but he has an above-average academic background and does know his subject matter well enough. Except that I didn't know economics or finance and hence I was basically trashed in that interview. He did say that I had a lot to prepare, but invited me to try again once I learned some of the necessary background.

So I did that, and after some time set up another interview with him. This one went well enough for him to allow me to do the next round with the traders, though advised that I work on some topics (such as the Black-Scholes model). Which I did. 

### Round 2 interview

That (with a pair of traders) was _way_ different from what I expected. Instead of asking me on what I thought I would be asked on, they starting picking on me immediately on my lack of a formal trading background or experience and point-blank told me that I wasn't ready and they were looking for someone with more experience.

### Notification of rejection

I was effectively told that from the Round 2 interview, and a more formal one came a lot later. I also earned an application ban for one year.

### Takeaway

I am not sure what they were looking for. The job description was clear enough in that I didn't need experience, otherwise I would have not applied in the first place. Plus, (recruiter) actually misled me by telling me to work on topics that were very different from what I would be asked for - if you knew that the traders would not accept someone with no experience, why would you give them false hope? The good news is that I did learn some useful stuff in options that did help me to an extent when I would take Computational Finance later.
