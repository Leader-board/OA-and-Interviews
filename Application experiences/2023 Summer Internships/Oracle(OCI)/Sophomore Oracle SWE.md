# Phone Screen
Application was sent in beginning of August 2022. First call with recruiter was middle of August 2022. Phone screening, asked about personal background
resume experiences, and interest in Oracle. 30 min conversation and recruiter said would be scheduled for first round interiew.

I should preface the following by saying that your recruiter will send an interview prep packet prior to each interview with tips and advice. Look at the 
OCI core values and think about how you can tie your past experiences to really emphasize these values because they stress them during recruiting. 

# 1st Round Interview
Heard back from recruiter beginning of October. Scheduled first round interview for middle of Oct. 1 hour interview with new grad SWE on OCI team that had
been with Oracle for a little over a year. Very conversational interview, about 30 mins of behavioral questions regarding my background, challenges in the 
workplace and technical projects. Then 30 minute technical interview.

Given the option to chosen between 1 of 2 LC easy style questions. Due to NDA reasons can not disclose exact questions asked but can say the categories.

1) String based question where you had turn strings into integers based on preassigned values
2) Array Manipulation type question

Heard back from recruiter same day about 3-5 hours later with news that I would be scheduled for a 3 hour loop interview superday

# OCI Superday

So I was told that it would 3 back to back interviews intially. But then I got the email confirming times and it was only 2. ü´° Anyway it was 2, 1 hour
back to back interviews with senior level engineers with OCI. 

First Interview:

1 hour behavioral but specifically dove into the technical aspects of my past projects and asked me to describe my front end experience, previous internship, 
and other leadership experiences extremely in depth. My interviewer had me ask questions throughout the interview and it was almost a 60%, 40% split of me
and him talking which really put me at ease. 

Second Interview:

1 hour mix of behavioral and technical, similar to first round but with harder technical question.

LC easy to medium level question, again array manipulation

Then a series of extensive behavioral questions to determine my fit. During the technical round, I had a lot of nervousness and got a couple of hints 
but was able to write efficient and correct code. 

# Offer Timeline

I heard back from my recruiter in 2 days after the superday with the news of a "soft" verbal offer. Then about 10 business days later, we called again to
discuss the "official" verbal offer and they told the compensation and stipend package. This conversation was two weeks after the superday. Finally, 
I got the offer letter on the following Monday. üòÅ
