# The Applicant Experiences guide

### What this does

Provide a centralised location where users can share and read about interviews and application experiences for various companies, with a write-up design that is geared towards providing the most insight possible for the reader. 

### The purpose

* I've seen many people ask repetitive questions on places such as r/CSMajors. While one could argue that it's their (the users asking those questions) responsibility to search on the internet, the fact is that trying to perform a search on the internet is somewhat disorganised.
* More importantly, there needs to be a centralised location that spans many companies. On Reddit, I've gotten many private queries about Maverick Derivatives - which isn't a company I thought a lot would be asking. This is my attempt to help users. 
* Most "mainstream" locations where people would ordinarily put write-ups (such as Reddit and LeetCode) lack the depth and insight that I am trying to achieve in this repository (partially because these sites are designed for "short" writeups). Where possible, official interview feedback and data is available. 

### Notes and rules

* There is no restriction in location - initially it may seem like the roles are biased towards Europe, but that's because I applied for roles there. 
* Dates should include the month name in full.
* Mention the location and date, putting them in the right year group (which is by recruiting season, so a role for September 2021 goes in the 2020-21 category)
* Do not mention applications still in progress.
* Successful applications **are** allowed. The status isn't as important as the depth and insightful-ness - this is what differentiates this repository from more "mainstream" places such as the average write-up on Reddit or LeetCode. 

Please include as much detail into your experience as possible - I'm aiming for something in the level of [this one](2021-22/Microsoft/UK%20New%20Grad.md) or [this one](2021-22/Facebook/Software%20Engineer,%20University%20Grad.md), and I would prefer a similar style to be used, including the presence of the major headings. 

_Online assessments_

For instance, include all details about the online examination (if any). When doing so, please indicate the difficulty of the questions corresponding to LeetCode levels. If the question was directly recycled from LeetCode, use its indication, otherwise give a good approximation. When doing so,  

* a LeetCode Easy should not require knowledge of optimisation techniques that are not immediately obvious and are normally "gimmes"
* a LeetCode Medium may include optimisation techniques, including but not limited to greedy and DP. A 1-D DP is usually a Medium, a 2-D DP is on the upper end of Medium and can also be a Hard. 
* a LeetCode Hard may make use of obscure optimisation techniques (eg ask for Tarjan's algorithm) or be otherwise extremely hard to solve (this should not be a "just my impression" case!), such as requiring 3-D DP or higher.

A reminder that for questions from LeetCode, their difficulty estimation should be used and none else in general. Feel free to use terms such as "borderline" if that would help. 

_Disclosing interview questions_

This is permitted **as long** as you are not prohibited from doing so in any way. For instance, if you have signed a NDA or the company has explictly asked you not to share them, you may not share them here either. 

Questions from online assessments may **not** be shared in any circumstance.

_Giving names of recruiters or interviewers_

It was planed that this would be allowed, since I wanted to make the write-up as complete as possible. However, during private testing, a concern was raised that this could cause people to be uncomfortable, and indeed this does not appear to be allowed by Reddit at least. I considered the possibility of allowing only first names, but then it was very easy to uniquely identify the person through a simple search on the internet. Hence I've decided to disallow giving names of anyone that isn't the applicant as a result (unless the name is of a relatively high rank as in [Visa](2021-22/Visa/Software%20Engineering%20and%20Testing%20Graduate.md)). Not my choice really; I just didn't want to run into any unintended trouble. Using placeholders such as (recruiter) in-place is fine. 

_Experiences that do not go here_

Perfectly generic failures (that is, you got kicked out right after application). There needs to be _something_ beyond "I applied and failed".
