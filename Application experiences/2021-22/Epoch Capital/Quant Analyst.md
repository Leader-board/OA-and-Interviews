## Quant Analyst

### Parameters

* Role: Quant Analyst
* Location: Sydney, Australia
* Applied: September 19, 2021
* Notified of failure: September 23, 2021

### The interview and failure

The interview was with HR and completely non-technical. She appeared concerned on my Python knowledge (while I consider it to be basic, I do not consider it limiting since I can quickly pick it up and have solved entrance exams in Python before), and I had to stress to her that my "basic" knowledge isn't a problem in practice (note that if I were to pass this one, the next one would be a HackerRank entrance exam, presumably to be completed in Python alone). 

However, (what I think was) the last question tripped me. She asked me on whether I required sponsorship, and I said that I would (since I'm not an Australian/New Zealand citizen, nor have studied there either) and there she said that they would not be able to continue with my application. However, she clearly explained _why_ they could not offer sponsorship and asked me to keep an eye for possible openings in London.

I got a subsequent failure email a few days later.

### Takeaway

* I'm a bit surprised they didn't realise that I needed sponsorship till the interview - I thought both my location then (from the Middle East) and educational background (from UK) would make them ask for it. Also, I gave them a piece of feedback at the interview - if you have to block candidates requiring sponsorship, _tell it_! Nowhere in the job description did they mention that they cannot offer sponsorship - and while they did say that my suggestion was good and that they would pass it on, clearly they didn't since I can see the same issue in their recent job openings for Sydney and New York as of December 21, 2021. Now those roles may require experience, but telling whether sponsorship can be provided is a good idea either way so that these kinds of issues would not occur.
* That being said, I appreciate that they told me this. It is rare that I have a company that concisely explains why exactly they rejected me - in this case they cannot offer sponsorship to a candidate like me that doesn't have at least two years' experience. They explained that it was an issue with the [Australian 482 visa](https://immi.homeaffairs.gov.au/visas/getting-a-visa/visa-listing/temporary-skill-shortage-482) which requires two years' experience in a relevant field, and I could verify this by a simple search on the internet. This further helped me understand why the majority of roles I see for Australia explicitly block those needing sponsorship - which was something I was confused till then as I didn't know that Australia was US-like in the difficulty of getting a work visa. If only more companies would do this; seriously I would appreciate it (not just for visa-related issues). Interestingly, the interviewer was from the UK.
