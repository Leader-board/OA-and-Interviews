## Software Engineering and Testing Graduate

### Parameters

* Role: Software Engineering and Testing Graduate
* Location: Reading, United Kingdom
* Date of application: December 6, 2021
* Notification of failure: December 19, 2021

### HackerRank entrance exam

This appears to be something everyone gets. 2 questions, 60 minutes. 

The exam was harder than I expected. The first one was a LeetCode Medium, pesky but something I quickly finished. The second one was a harder LeetCode medium and was a tricky 2-D DP problem - I didn't expect that one to show up for a company like Visa (that would previously cheap out by using Arctic Shores). While I did get it fully right in the end, it did take up time, and I was left with only 6 minutes in the end. Note that the HackerRank title included "New Grad-Masters/PhD" - suspect undergraduates would be served easier questions? I also suspect that a full mark would not be required to progress to the next round given its relative difficulty. 

### Situational judgement exam

After that (not immediately though), I was asked to complete a SJT (situational judgement test). This was 15 questions, and while the question did have a SWE flavour in it (for instance, referencing terms such as scrum), it was otherwise not different from the others I've done. 

### Notification of failure

Right after doing the test, I was notified that I failed the test and would be kicked out immediately:

I also got a "feedback report" by email. The only meaningful page was this:

It should not be hard to guess the usefulness (almost none) - it was definitely not "helpful" and the "possible development activities" is junk without more context. 

### Takeaway

* I'm used to failing SJT tests and its derivatives - in fact I rarely do _not_ fail them. That being said, I have a feeling this was also implicitly looking for some SWE experience - of which I have none. Maybe I'm wrong there, but the terminology contained more SWE-based terms than some others I've done. 
* I hate SJT tests with passion.
