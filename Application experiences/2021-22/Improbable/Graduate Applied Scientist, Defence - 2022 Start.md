## Graduate Applied Scientist, Defence - 2022 Start

### Parameters

* Role: Graduate Applied Scientist, Defence - 2022 Start
* Location: London, United Kingdom
* Applied: October 29, 2021
* Notification of failure: December 13, 2021

### HackerRank entrance exam

Seems like this is given to everyone, and the title made me think that the contents are independent of the role being applied for. They explicitly mentioned that a full mark is not required for progression, which makes sense since this is a relatively harder exam for 75 minutes (2 questions). I do appreciate that they mentioned that, but telling the exact pass mark would have been useful. 

* Q1 was a slightly ambiguous LeetCode Medium that involved my chaining a pair of 1-D DP arrays. The ambiguity made me run into a few false starts and resulted in this taking longer than I'd like. That being said this is not an easy question given that they claim it to be.
* Q2 was a LeetCode Hard. A tricky subsequence problem, I could reduce it to O(_n_<sup>2</sup>) by sorting + 2 pointers and could have reduced it further to the expected O(_n_ log _n_) if I improved my two-pointer solution but ran out of time in doing so. I still managed to get 14/15 test cases right despite that. Note that while the "bruteforce" solution is O(*n* 2<sup>_n_</sup>), trying that would have been useless here as not many test cases were small enough for that.

### The interview that never happened

As expected, (the recruiter) reached out to me and asked me to schedule the first-round interview. Note the contents carefully:

<blockquote>
Dear Leader

We have received your application for the opportunity of 'Graduate Applied Scientist, Defence - 2022 Start' at Improbable and would love to arrange a conversation to discuss your profile and also give you some more information on what weâ€™re doing here and more detail about the role.

The easiest way to do this is to find a time that works for you directly on our Talent Team's calendar using the automatic scheduler. However, if you struggle to find a slot that works for you in the coming weeks do let me know over email which time blocks work for you as I can juggle our calendar.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards, <br>
(recruiter)
</blockquote>

Notice that this isn't a technical interview. Plus I was sent a couple of brochures that detailed the roles Improbable had in general - this confused me since I wasn't sure at that point whether I was being considered for _any_ role at Improbable _or_ the role I had applied for. 

Still, I scheduled the interview for November 29<sup>th</sup>. I didn't want to schedule it that late as I was concerned it could be too late, but there were no earlier dates.

At the day of the interview (201 minutes before it), I got this:

<blockquote>
Hi Leader,

Unfortunately an Internal Meeting has been put in my diary for the same time as our call, please can you provide me with your availability for the rest of the week so we can reschedule.

Apologies for any inconvenience caused

Many thanks, <br>
(recruiter)
</blockquote>

I sent my availability for a reschedule, but a few days later, got this instead:

<blockquote>
Hi Leader, 

I wanted to update you, the Applied Scientist role was put on hold this week, I am catching up with the Hiring Manager next week and will get an update then. I will get back to you ASAP on next steps

Thanks <br>
(recruiter)
</blockquote>

### Notification of failure

At this point I could figure out where this was going to end. And indeed:

<blockquote>
Dear Leader

Thank you for your application to the Graduate Applied Scientist, Defence - 2022 Start position at Improbable. I'm sorry to say that we have now filled this position and are no longer accepting applications.

However, I wanted to let you know that we reviewed your application in detail and will get back to you in the future if anything suitable comes up.

Kind regards, <br>
(recruiter)
</blockquote>

Fail. Didn't bother asking for feedback given how early into the process I failed. At least it was out of my control.

### Takeaway

Not much I could do here, felt defeated at this one even though it was out of my control.
