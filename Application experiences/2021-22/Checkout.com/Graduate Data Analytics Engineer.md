## Graduate Data Analytics Engineer

### Parameters

* Role: Quantitative Trader - 2022 Programme
* Location: London, United Kingdom
* Applied: February 24, 2022
* Notification to take entrance exam: March 4, 2022
* Notification of failure: March 18, 2022

### HackerRank entrance exam

After applying, I was sent an email saying that they would be sending HackerRank entrance exams "in the next few days" - and indeed, I was sent one about a week later.

The test had two portions:

* 10 questions on SQL trivia. Unfortunately, while I did take a database module, that was a while ago, and I struggled to answer quite a few of them. LeetCode is unlikely to help.
* 3 SQL coding questions. The same comments apply as above, except that they map well to LeetCode Medium questions on SQL. It's been a long while since I last did SQL practice on LeetCode (and SQL isn't something I do a _lot_ of work in either), and did them poorly. It did surprise me that I was unable to get even one of them fully, but again I didn't remember things such as subqueries which the questions seemed to be looking for. 

### Notification of failure

Not a surprise given how poorly I did in the exam:

<blockquote>

BTW: instead of giving rubbish about "careful comparison of the skills" and whatnot, why not just tell that I failed the entrance exam? How hard is that? And sending the exam marks of a candidate is really not that difficult either. 

### The GDPR attempt

I sent a GDPR request to the data protection officer, and the only useful piece of information I got in return was my entrance exam mark (23.3%; 42/180). They even hid the question titles, so I didn't know if I got any marks on the coding questions either! There was also a "CV score sheet" file, which had this in it which I couldn't understand:

<blockquote>

A: 3 <br>
W: 2 <br>
L: 1 <br>
A/W/L Total: 6 <br>
Decision: Yes <br>
HR: 24

</blockquote>

### Takeaway

* Unfortunately, I didn't know much SQL trivia and neither did I practice/work SQL beyond the basics, and hence this is a rare case for me, where a poor coding entrance exam mark is the direct cause of a failure. If you can do LeetCode Mediums in SQL comfortably, you should be fine though. Also I don't think there is any real partial marking either - you need to get the format exactly right or you won't get anything (this is not likely in a normal coding problem where the output format is easy to follow). 
* The HackerRank exam contained a nasty surprise - I was apparently not allowed to change tabs (which is standard practice to, for instance, lookup syntax) - even though this was not mentioned anywhere in the exam (and scared me as you'd get a message saying that my activity is being tracked and that the recruier can see how many times I went out of the testing window)! OK, I don't mind following the rules, but you need to be explicit and not mislead people... The same issue also applied to Twitter's exams by the way.
