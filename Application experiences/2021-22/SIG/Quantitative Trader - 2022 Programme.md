### Mathematical entrance exam

This does not appear to be automatic, though I'm not sure on whether everyone gets it. 

The exam contains 14 questions of a mainly probability nature (with a focus on expectations) and a couple of brain-teasers. While the questions are not particularly hard themselves, there's only 20 minutes in total, so one is likely to be pressured for time. Example questions would be finding the expectation of a particular infinite stream or finding whether a particular bet is good (which would involve comparing the expected value with the value of the bet). The questions were a mix of MCQ and fill in the blanks (usually an integer). 

### Round 1 interview

This was with a recruiter from HR. Notice that while they are from HR, they usually have significantly better mathematical understanding that average (in fact, their application for a recruiter wants potential candidates to have done coursework in mathematics). 

The interview was a split between stock (non-technical) and probability-based questions. I was served five probability question (again focusing on expectations, through there was one on Bayes' theorem). While I did get them all, I had to request hints for a couple. Preparing from quant guides such as Heard on the Street or similar should help. 

The non-technical portion was generally standard with some tricky questions. While the classic ones (why SIG, why quant) were asked, tricky ones included:
* how I did "so well" in my undergraduate - while I had a first, it was a very low first and that isn't a case of "done so well" given that getting a first isn't impressive _at all_.
* what my research supervisor would tell about me

### Notification of failure

Was by email. A request to feedback did not elicit a response (this was despite them explicitly telling at my Round 1 interview that I'm free to ask for feedback). When I asked them later about this at my university's career fair, I was told that my interviewer was on leave then and would come later. I didn't ask again after that.

### Takeaway

This one stung. It is hard for me to find a role that I am really interested in, and I thought I did OK in the interview. I think my mathematical skills are still not at the level of what they should be (which is likely) or that I somehow messed up in the non-technical portion (also possible). Hard to be certain without feedback. Long way to go it seems.
