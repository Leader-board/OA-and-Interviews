## Software Engineer - New Grad 2022 (Remote)

### Parameters

* Location: Remote (worldwide)
* Role: Software Engineer - New Grad 2022 (Remote)
* Applied: August 22, 2021
* Asked to do CodeSignal: October 1, 2021
* Round 1 technical interview: November 18, 2021
* Round 2 non-technical interview: December 7, 2021
* Notification of failure: December 10, 2021

### CodeSignal examination

I am not sure whether this is something everyone gets - I've gotten it in the past, but didn't do well then. This time I got a 843, which is what I sent to them. It's otherwise a standard GCA exam. 

### Round 1 technical interview

This was with (interviewer). The interview was focused on one question divided into three parts. Unfortunately, I did have to sign a NDA of some kind and hence will not be disclosing the question in full (the third part of this question was in a LeetCode Discuss post when I checked later).

* The first third was a LeetCode Medium which I completed fully (implementation based)
* The second third was a harder LeetCode Medium which I had to work my way towards, but think I pulled off in the end (though didn't write any code there). The idea involved binary search.
* The last third was a borderline (if not already) a LeetCode Hard - while I did attempt to work it out, I don't think I did well and didn't give a full answer in my view. 

For some reason, I did not fail the interview.

### Round 2 interview

This was with (interviewer 2), who happened to be an engineering manager at Quora. His questions had a stock element to it, asking for instance
* why I applied to Quora (and asked about the remote part)
* the factors I would look when choosing a job

No technical questions were asked. One thing I missed is that I thought I would get into the team of my preference. That wasn't quite right - turns out that one applies to the role alone and the team is (while they would consider my preference) up to them. Another thing worth mentioning is that while they normally stick to their coordination hours (9 AM to 3 PM Pacific Standard Time), there is some flexibility in that it may be possible to deviate from that for those who do not have a need to be there (for instance, do not have that many interviews). 

### Notification of failure

Was by an email three days after the interview. A request for feedback did not get answered as of writing. 

### Takeaway

* I had my interviews all at night (9 PM GMT +3). This is not a coincidence - that was the earliest time I could schedule my interview as I had to work with their 10 AM - 5 PM PST (Pacific Standard Time) requirement!
* Turns out that Round 2 was a "lightweight" round and that the real challenge comes in Round 3 (the virtual onsites). So it would be a valid question to ask on why I failed in such a round. As noted above, I did not get feedback on why I failed. One part I think I might have messed up was in a section when I was asked something on the lines of "would you be OK to do full-stack work" (responding to my preferences) - to which I replied "I'm not sure; I will need to think". While my answer was honest, I suspect it may not have been the "right" answer.
