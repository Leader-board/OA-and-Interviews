## Markets & Securities Services - Quantitative Finance - Full-Time Associate Programme

### Parameters

* Role: Markets & Securities Services - Quantitative Finance - Full-Time Associate Programme
* Location: London, United Kingdom
* Applied: September 20, 2021
* Notified of failure: October 2, 2021

### Immersive online assessment

This is automatically sent out immediately after application (assuming that the minimum criteria are met), and is irrespective of the role applied for. The test itself is no different from similar tests from other companies, comprising situational judgement, reading comprehension and mathematics tests, and isn't timed at all. The mathematics and verbal questions aren't hard by themselves (though can be boring) - I did OK as a non-native English speaker. 

I didn't fail this one. The "feedback report" I got after this section (as usual, almost useless) will be attached at the end of this write-up. 

### Job simulation assessment

A couple of days after doing the first entrance exam, I was asked to do a "job simulation" examination through Hirevue. This exam is generally meant to be specific to the role applied for, and hence I wasn't sure what to prepare for. Note that they do offer a practice exam, but that is generic and didn't help for the actual examination. 

<blockquote>
Well done, you have been selected to take part in the next stage of the assessment process! This is a Job Simulation assessment and will give you greater insight into the business area you have applied to. The assessment will cover verbal, written skills and behavioural alignment to HSBC using video recording, written response and rank-order questions. The assessment takes approximately 35 minutes to complete, if you think you need additional time to support you with any adjustments please reply to this email.
</blockquote>

Now, the actual exam was from the Markets and Securities Services division. Despite the title of the role I applied for, this surprised me because I was of the understanding that I applied for a quantitative finance role, and the questions appeared to be the same as a non-quant markets role. That is, it didn't test anything quantitative (except basic data analysis), mathematical and didn't have a coding section either. The questions I had included:

* a video question that gave a schedule and asked me how I would arrange it given a set of constraints (the schedule was set up in such a way that it would not be possible to complete _every_ one)
* some video questions that appeared to be behavioral (that is, classic SJT/situational judgement test-styled)
* some SJT-based questions revolving around data and traditional SJT questions
* some personality questions
* an email response question revolving around analysis of data

The test in itself wasn't particularly insightful or useful, and I didn't like that there were video and SJT questions in the test.

### Notification of failure

3 days after the test, I got this:

<blockquote>

Dear Leader,

We would like to thank you for completing the Job Simulation as part of your HSBC application to the position of Markets & Securities Services - Quantitative Finance - Full-Time Associate Programme (UK - London).

In order to gain a full understanding of the meaning of your test results, your performance has been compared to that of a large group of individuals who have previously completed these tests when applying for a Graduate / Internship role at HSBC Global Businesses.

It is with regret that we must advise you that unfortunately you have not been successful in meeting our requirements.

Regrettably it is not possible to provide individual feedback due to the high number of applications we receive. We trust, however, that the Feedback Report following the completion of the Online Immersive Assessment, giving you some insight into how you can work on your highest and lowest scoring attributes, has been useful.

If you could spare a few moments, we would be really keen to hear your feedback on the Job Simulation, as well as your HSBC journey to date.  We would therefore ask that, if you have time, you complete our survey by clicking the link below:

We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest in HSBC and wish you every success for the future.

Kind regards <br>

As expected, the email had nothing useful in it, and no, the "Feedback Report" after the online assessment wasn't of any use either. Yet you want us to provide feedback...

### Takeaway

* It should be noted that this role (being an "Associate" and not an "Analyst") has relatively higher requirements compared to most other HSBC graduate roles. Specifically, a "quantitative" masters degree is mandatory (which I would have). Hence I was a bit surprised with the Hirevue interview, but then arguably that is not an excuse. The role is definitely interesting in itself and hence this failure did sting. 
* This is my third consecutive year I've applied to HSBC (for three different roles), and completes my hat-trick of failures there. All at the same pesky job simulation stage...
* It appears that I am so bad that I didn't even meet a "minimum" benchmark. I inferred this from looking at [reports on The Student Room](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/showthread.php?t=7100404), where the majority reported getting an email that they passed a "minimum benchmark" which in turn only means that they are in consideration for selection to the next stage. 

### Appendix: Feedback report after the immersive assessment

It was as useless as expected - clearly there is nothing unique about the feedback report other than the titles that come up. Plus the "opportunities" section doesn't do anything useful either. What I want to know is _how_ my answers made you think the way you did - that way I can at least understand what I could be missing. I hate these tests...

**Your Key Strengths**

This section gives you feedback on the areas that we identified as your key strengths, in relation to roles at HSBC.
Your results suggest that one of your highest strengths is **Critical Analyst**.

You are likely to be the type of person who enjoys analysing problems and complex information. You take a structured and logical
approach to interpreting this information, using your analysis to identify patterns and reach robust conclusions.

Opportunities to develop this strength further…

* Reflect on information from different perspectives to understand how different people may interpret it. Use these different
  perspectives to find a justified conclusion which minimises contradiction.
* Stretch your ability to analyse complex information by checking over the analysis of others who may be more experienced.
  Look to see if the conclusions you have made are accurate based on the data, and ask questions to support your
  understanding.
* To deepen your understanding of the information you have, reflect on its source. Think about where it has come from, and
  what possible biases might exist which could impact on your interpretation. Amend your conclusions accordingly based on
  this understanding.

Take care...

While it is great that you are able to analyse and interpret problems, make sure you do not become too dependent on having
every piece of information possible. Some decisions might need to be made without having all the information available.

Your results suggest that one of your highest strengths is **Numerical Reasoning**.

You are likely to be the type of person who thrives when using numerical information and data, no matter how complex it is. You are
likely to have a good understanding of mathematical concepts and be able to carry out calculations to solve problems accurately.

Opportunities to develop this strength further…

* Numerical reasoning does not always have to be used to solve large, complex problems. Consider going online to practise
  numerical problems or puzzles, or take online tutorials to test yourself on different material.
* Your interest in and confidence with numerical data may mean you immediately begin analysing numerical information when
  presented with it. Before you look to analyse it, reflect on what information will be the most useful, and which, if any,
  information is not necessary for what you are looking to achieve.
* Once you have completed a calculation or a piece of analysis, reflect on it and check your solution. Work from your result
  back to your initial calculation to carefully check for any possible errors that could have impacted on subsequent calculations,
  and to identify any further analysis that will reveal greater insight.

Take care...

* There are many other types of information that can supplement numerical data. When you are making calculations, think
  about what the purpose is, and see if there is any other data that will be useful to consider.

Your results suggest that one of your highest strengths is **We Take Responsibility**.

You are likely to be the type of person who is guided by your values and acts in accordance with doing the right thing. You may feel
energised when you make decisions that you believe are right. You are unlikely to be afraid to speak up when you think there is a
better way of doing something, or if you think there is a problem.

Opportunities to develop this strength further…

* Act as an ethical role model for others. Encourage others to stand up for what they think is right.
* Expand your understanding of what others consider to be right and wrong and how they act in accordance with this. When
  working with others, they may have different opinions on what is right, so use this understanding to decide what the best
  course of action is.
* While you are acting in accordance with what you believe is right, think about how this behaviour impacts on others around
  you. Use this wider understanding, together with your values, to understand when it is more effective to stand up for what you
  believe in.

Take care...

While it is great that you always act in accordance with what you believe is right, make sure that you understand why a
decision has been made.

**Your Potential Areas of Development**

This section gives you feedback on the areas that we identified as your areas for development, of those that were included in the
assessment. These are likely to be areas in which you perform less well, or ones that you may not enjoy doing as much as your Key
Strengths. Please note that these should not be interpreted as weaknesses – they are simply the lowest scoring areas that were
assessed.

Your results suggest that one of your lowest strengths is **Learning Agility**.

You may prefer to rely on your existing knowledge and skills when faced with new situations rather than continuously seeking out
new information. You are likely to require more time to reflect on what you have learned before you are ready to apply it in practice.

Opportunities to develop this area further…

* Think about changing the way information is presented. There may be steps you could take that make it easier for you to
  absorb information. Make use of different layouts, colour coding and images instead of text to make it memorable and keep
  it interesting.
* Look for opportunities to start a conversation about something new you have learned and find out what other people know or
  think about it.
* Get into the habit of reviewing what went well and identifying things that you could do differently after every project or learning
  experience you have. There is plenty to be learned from reviewing your successes as well as your challenges
