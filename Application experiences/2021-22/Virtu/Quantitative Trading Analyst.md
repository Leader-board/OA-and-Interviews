### Codility entrance exam

I suspect everyone gets it, though I'm not sure. 5 questions, 75 minutes. However, the questions weren't hard - mostly on the lower end of LeetCode Medium (if not easies) and hence I completed in half time. Worth mentioning: as with any Codility examination, the sample test cases aren't enough and I would have blundered on a couple if I didn't verify with my own test cases. 

### Round 1 interview

This was rescheduled twice (with very short notice!) - that being said the reasons cited (storm Barra) were valid and made sense, through irritating. This was by a phone call and not using a VoIP medium like Zoom or Skype. 

She started the interview by telling that I did quite well in the coding examination (but as usual, refused to tell me what my score was). She then asked me generally HR questions (why Virtu, why quant), asked me (out of the blue!) what market making was in my own words and a couple of brain teasers, which went (paraphrased from memory) like this:

<blockquote>
* What is the angle between the minute and hour hand of a clock at 5:15 PM? <br>
* Follow-up: at what time would the minute and hour hand of a clock coincide after 5 PM?
</blockquote>

I finished them off quickly and correctly (in about 30 seconds). And that was the interview - fairly short and ended in ~15 minutes. 

_Postscript:_ the answers to the brainteasers:

* For the main question, let 0 degrees be the number 12 of the clock. Then, the minute hand would be 90° from the number 12. The hour hand would be 150 + (30/4) = 157.5°. The difference is hence |157.5°-90°|=67.5°
* For the follow-up, let _x_ be the minute. Then we need to find the angle subtended by the hour hand - from the first part, this is (150 + (30)_x_/60)°. The angle subtended by the minute hand is simply (6*x*)°. Solve for _x_: 150 + _x_/2 = 6*x* -> 150 = 11x/2 -> _x_ = 300/11. The answer can be shown to be somewhere between 5:27 and 5:28 PM. 

### Notification of failure

I got the failure notification in a day by email (which was expected as they told me I'd know of the result in a day). The email precluded any chance of getting feedback on my failure. 

### Takeaway

With a failure like this, I'm not sure what went wrong given that I did well in the coding examination and the brainteasers.
