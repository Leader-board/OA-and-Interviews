## Research Software Engineer
### Parameters:
* Applied: April 28, 2024
* Round 1 interview: July 18, 2024
* Finals: August 6, 2024
* Notification of failure: August 13, 2024

### Prelude

If we look at the job description (below), notice that it only wants people with a PhD (which I don't have, as I only had a masters). I actually applied since I read the "equivalent training" part instead, and I thought that my experience in undergraduate research would qualify. In other words, on paper I was underqualified and should not have gotten anywhere. Keep this in mind for the rest of this review.

Now, as is usual with me, Microsoft tends to ghost people and silently reject them (which means that you'll be left in the dark if you don't check the portal). I actually forgot about this as a result, and hence was pleasantly surprised to get this:

<blockquote>
Dear Leader, <br>
Thank you for application for a post-doc resident position at Microsoft Research Cambridge.   Please accept my apologies for the delay in getting back to you. <br>
Congratulations – you are through to the next stage!  This is a 45-minute phone-screen with me, over Teams.  We will chat about your previous work, I’ll let you know a bit more about the residency position, and we will also do a small amount of coding together on a shared whiteboarding website.  The aim is to have a technical conversation about a small bit of shared code, rather than an old-fashioned coding interview.  I’ll leave a bit of time at the end to cover any questions you might have.

Please could you suggest two 45-minute time slots over the next couple of weeks which would work for you?  I’ll then send you a Teams meeting request for the one which works for me.

Many thanks, <br>
[lead engineer]
</blockquote>

Notice that the email still says that it's for a "post-doc" even though I don't have a PhD. It wasn't clear to me as to what was going on here - is this "just in name" (i.e, that it's not really a post-doc)? Anyway: I scheduled this for one week later.

Now: naturally I looked for resources and guides. And there was very few. I asked on Reddit. No one responded. I asked elsewhere. No one responded. Existing Reddit posts were often years old. In the end, I tried to work using guides such as https://medium.com/@FisherDanyel/how-to-interview-as-an-industry-researcher-aa5130bbb99a (which was useful though generic). This lack of resources was a central problem throughout this application. 

### The first round interview

Was by Microsoft Teams by [lead engineer]. The interview roughly went like this:

* First they introduced themselves. This was around the time I asked them about the PhD question. Turns out that they were looking for people from various background, and felt that a masters provided some of the necessary research experience they were looking for.
* Then I was asked to (sort of) describe a project/work - which I did explain in some detail.
* After that, I was served a LeetCode Medium - coin change (greedy-friendly). It seems like Microsoft _really_ likes such problems, since they asked this in the [last time I managed to get to the finals with them](../../2021-22/Microsoft/UK New Grad.md). I coded it up, and he asked related questions (such as factors to consider if this was to production)
* I was given the chance to ask questions.

This took about 50 minutes in total.

### Getting to the second stage

_Note: while a NDA was signed, this does not preclude including any of the below information as far as the NDA is concerned._

After about a week, I got this:

<blockquote>

Dear Leader,

Thanks for taking the time to speak with me this week.  I’m happy to tell you that you are through to the next round.  This will be entirely virtual over Teams, and consist of a talk to our research team, followed by a short chat with our team leader, [team lead], and then a number of longer one-on-one interviews with members from across our group.

I’ll be engaging with our HR folks to put a schedule together, but they are currently on vacation until Monday, so expect an email sometime next week with more details.

Many thanks, <br>
[lead engineer]

</blockquote>

OK that's nice. And indeed the HR was on holiday; a few days later, I got this:

<blockquote>
Good morning Leader

My name is [recruiter], I work in the Recruiting Team for Microsoft Research.

[lead engineer] has asked me to get in touch to invite you to attend a Final Round Interview for the Research Software Engineer position – congratulations!

The interviews will be  held virtually over Teams and will consist of a talk to our Research Team (45 mins talk plus 15 mins for questions), followed by a 15-minute chat with our team leader, and then four 45 minute one-on-one interviews with members from across our group.  Those interviews will cover your recent work, skills, and learning mindset.

Please can you confirm your availability over the next week – specifically any dates or times we should avoid, and also the time zone you are currently in?

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes 

[recruiter]
</blockquote>

She also attached a couple of PDF files: [microsoft[2]2.pdf](..%2F..%2F..%2Fmedia%2Fmicrosoft%5B2%5D2.pdf) and [microsoft[2]3.pdf](..%2F..%2F..%2Fmedia%2Fmicrosoft%5B2%5D3.pdf). The second PDF isn't all that useful. The first one however is, and it confused me even further. Notice that I need to submit a full research talk - but I _don't_ have _that_ much experience! I didn't really know what to do there, and as expected, the internet was useless and there were no real reviews on how people prepared for it - let alone someone without a PhD. The other problem was the date. I was travelling for the entirety of next week and my schedule was hence rather tight - I could find only one free day (Tuesday) to conduct the interview. I did suggest that day to them, with the additional note that they let me know when they'll be available if Tuesday wouldn't work for them.

I responded a day later (right after she sent a reminder) with my availability, but didn't get a response. On Friday, I got this:

<blockquote>
Hi Leader,

Our Scheduling Team will be in touch to get this organised for you today.  We usually try and run the interviews consecutively on the same day, but this will depend on co-ordinating yours and the Assessors availability.  

The Scheduling Team will be sending you a talk form which we need for the organisation of your presentation, please can you return this to us as soon as possible.  For your information, you may notice the reference “Research Intern” in your interview confirmation – Researchers are classed as Interns on our internal systems due to the temporary nature of the role and again this is to be expected.

If you have any questions in the meantime, please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Kind regards

[recruiter]
</blockquote>

OK... and what did the team in the "scheduling team" send?

<blockquote>

Hi Leader,

Good day! I hope all is well.

Congratulations on being selected for the Final Round of interviews for the Research Software Engineer position with Microsoft!

Attached to this email is a form with some details you will need to fill out regarding the talk you will give(Presentation) as part of your interview. Please fill out the form and send it back to me as soon as you can.

I will also need you to sign an NDA for your interview via Microsoft Teams, can you please confirm your home address to enable me to create this for you.

Should you have any questions concerning interview scheduling, please feel free to contact me at [email]

For queries concerning the recruitment process and feedback from your interview, you may contact the recruiter directly. Her contact details are as follows: [recruiter] - [recruiter email]

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I look forward to hearing from you and I will be in touch again soon.

Kind Regards, <br>

The "scheduler"'s email (v-, meaning _vendor_) suggested that they are a third party on behalf of Microsoft.

What was the attachment about? It was a Word file with the following:

<blockquote>
Lecture Details

* Duration: 45-minute talk with 15 minutes Q&A
* Speaker Bio
* Title
* Abstract
* Applicable Audience: Select one of the following: 
  * Microsoft Full Time Employees
  * Microsoft Research Full Time Employees
  * Microsoft Research Cambridge UK Full Time Employees
* Recording/Broadcasting Option: Select one of the following options (Please note, if you chose to have your lecture recorded you will be required to sign a Speaker Release form. Without this signed form, we are unable to record your lecture.)
  * Do not record/room only
  * Record - make available as per the above applicable audience
* Additional Notes
</blockquote>

So up until now I was under the impression that I just present without any sort of advance notice - this was unexpected and a further sort of confusion since again I'm not someone with a PhD and what's with the "recording/broadcasting" option? This is a job interview, not a conference... I did ask on whether I could have a couple of days for this, but was told that I needed to submit by "EOB" (end of business) the same day, without conveniently mentioning the timezone (as that person seemed to be located in the Philippines but was working US business hours?). With no choice, I came up with one (essentially similar to the idea I did in my first-round interview) and submitted that. I also queried the recruiter on whether slides were expected, who replied in the affirmative.

I also got the schedule that way - which again was a bit surprising (all times are UTC+1 or London time with DST)

* Meeting with the hiring manager - 4 pm to 4:15 pm on August 5th

The others were on the 6th:

* Research Talk: 10 am to 11 am
* One to one interview 1: 11:15 am to 12 pm
* One to one interview 2: 1 pm to 1:45 pm
* One to one interview 3: 2 pm to 2:45 pm
* One to one interview 4: 3 pm to 3:45 pm

The only problem was the one on 5th, not because it was a day before but because I was travelling on that day (I calculated that I should be able to reach my hotel with ~100 minutes to spare). I notified the recruiter about this, who said that it was OK and to keep him updated in case of any issues. 

Over the next few days, I tried what I could to prepare the presentation and other components (it was unfortunate that I was also busy with my travel preparation). Again, resources were non-existent in both video and text form and I was finding this pretty hard. 

On August 5th, things unfortunately did not go to plan. My flight landed on time, but my connecting transport had an unexpected delay, and worse I miscalculated the distance _and_ there was quite some traffic at the end which meant that I was not at my hotel by the time of the interview. ~20 minutes before, I tried contacting the scheduling person, no response. It turns out that:

> Thank you for your email. I’m currently out sick today but will get back to you as soon as I can upon my return. 

... anyway at the meeting time, I used my mobile data to connect to the interview, and asked if he would be willing to have it an hour later. He agreed to this. In the end, I reached my hotel room with 15 minutes to spare.

### The finals

#### Round 1

This was basic. Basically asked me on why I was late, and explained about what the role was and common misconceptions people have about the role (for example, the role is fixed-time - one is not guaranteed a permanent research role and there apparently aren't that many, and you'll be primarily working for a group, and it's more team-based than a post-doc). This was helpful, but I felt that some sort of FAQ should have been placed in the site. I also queried about how I should handle the research interview - and that actually was helpful (i.e, they know that and it's OK to adapt and customise the guide to your case - this should have been told before!). Not much else was there - which after all was expected for a 15-minute call.

The rest of the rounds happened the next day.

#### Round 2 (the research talk)

This did not go well:

* Severe network issues, where they couldn't hear me for some reason. This was so bad that in the end I resorted to using my phone (which is a foldable, so it was actually manageable)
* They also didn't seem as interested in what I presented, with not that many questions asked and nothing at the end. I don't know whether this is just my perception, whether my presentation was out of scope or too trivial or easy or whatever. I just didn't feel good about it. Note that some of the interviewers later said that they liked my talk, but I was not convinced that they were just trying to be nice.

#### Round 3 (the first technical round)

Note that in the initial interview invite, the Codility link was missing - I did inform the interviewer and Round 1 about this. This interviewer actually asked when I wanted the interview, and when this was clarified, provided his Codility link.

First I was asked questions about the presentation - this was actually meaningful. Then came the LeetCode problem - the code below is self-explanatory:

```csharp
namespace N {
    class C {

        // Compute average pixel value in the image.
        public uint8 ComputeAverage(uint8[][] image)
        {
            // 1 2 3
            // 2 3 4
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i[]: image) // i = 1 2 3
            {
                for (int j: i) 
                sum+=j;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < image.Length; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < image[0].Length; j++)
                {
                    sum+=image[i][j];
                }
            }
            return sum/(image.Length * image[0].length);
        }

        // Compute a new image where each pixel is the same as in the input image
        // if greater or equal to threshold value, 0 otherwise
        // Example:
        // 12 56 14                    0  56  0
        // 04 42 99  -threshold=20 ->  0  42  0
        // 23 60 21                    23 60 21
        public uint8[][] ThresholdImage(uint8[][] image, uint8 thresholdValue)
        {
            uint8[][] new_image = new int[image.length][image[0].length];
            for (int i = 0; i < image.Length; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < image[0].Length; j++)
                {
                    new_image[i][j] = (image[i][j] >= thresholdValue ? image[i][j] : 0);
                }
            }
            return new_image;
        }

        // Extra credit: extract a subset of the image.
        // Example:
        // 12 56 14                                                    
        // 04 42 99  --startRow=1, startColumn=1, width=2, height=2--> 42 99
        // 23 60 21                                                    60 21
        public uint8[][] CutImage(uint8[][] image, int startRow, int startColumn, int width, int height)
        {
            int[][] cut_image = new int[width][height];
            // TODO make sure that we can actually cut the image - for example does not go out of bounds
            if (width - 1 + startRow >= image.Length || height - 1 + startColumn >= image[0].length)
            return null;
            for (int i = 0; i < width; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < height; j++)
                {
                    cut_image[i][j] = image[i + startRow][j + startColumn];
                }
            }
            return cut_image;
        }

        // Extra extra credit: convolution
        public uint8[][] AverageConvolutionFilter(uint8[][] image, uint8 kernelSize)
        {
            uint8[][] output = new int[image.length][image[0].length];

            for (int i = 0; i < image.Length; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < image[0].Length; j++)
                {
                    int sum = 0;
                    int cnt = 0;
                    for (int k = 0; k < image.Length; k++)
                    {
                        for (int l = 0; l < image[0].Length; l++)
                        {
                            int diff = Math.abs(i - k) + Math.abs(j - l);
                            if (diff <= kernelSize && diff != 0)
                            {
                                sum += diff;
                                cnt++;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    output[i][j] = sum/cnt;
                }
            }
            return output;
        }
    }
}
```

Notice that the four parts were a ramp up in terms of difficulty - starting from an easy leetcode to a Medium at the last stage (when optimised - I did not do it nor was I expected to, but I was asked on how I'd improve the code). And that was about it (was given the chance to ask questions). Network issues were still a problem at this stage.

#### Round 4 (the second technical interview)

The first part was system design, where I was given a situation about a Python tool used to extract images and upload to the server. The questions were OK and not too complex (eg how I would design it, scaling etc), albeit hard to understand at times. 

Then came the technical component. Again, the code is self-explanatory and would be a LeetCode easy:

```csharp
package com.codility;

// you can also use imports, for example:
// import java.util.*;

public class Solution {


        // Repeat a waveform multiple times with different amplitudes.
        // @waveform: an array of samples that make up the waveform (volts, -1.0 to 1.0).
        // @amplitudes: list of amplitudes for each repeat (0.0 to 1.0).
        //
        // Returns the original waveform repeated once for every element in
        // @amplitudes, with each repeat scaled to that amplitude.

        // Example:
        // RepeatWaveForm(waveform=[-1.0, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0], amplitudes=[1.0, 0.25, 0.5])
        //  -> [-1.0, 0.5, -0.5, 1.0,  -0.25, 0.125, -0.125, 0.25,  -0.5, 0.25, -0.25, 0.5]

        public ArrayList<Double> RepeatWaveform(double[] waveform, double[] amplitudes)
        {
            ArrayList<Double> result = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < amplitude.length; i++)
            {
                for (int j = 0; j < waveform.length; j++)
                {
                    result.add(waveform[j] * amplitude[i]);
                }
            }
            return result;
        }

        public converttosignal(double d)
        {
            return (int)((65535d/2d)(1d + d);
        }

        // U16  0x0000 = -1V  0xffff = +1V
}
```

The network issues were particularly severe in this interview.

#### Round 5 (the first non-technical interview)

This one was a bit unexpected - this was all about Microsoft's diversity and inclusion and how my working experience correlated with it. For example the diversity of where I work (I work for a client) and how I would ensure diversity amongst the client's employees, and how I would ensure diversity in the hiring process (?). This was rather strange to me, and while I did honestly explain my stance, it was not something I had to deal with in a prior interview. 

Then they said "this is not amongst the questions I had planned to ask" and went on to implicitly ask my opinion on affirmative action, claiming that they benefited from it but understood my stance on this topic! This was a bit surprising, though I did again explain my viewpoint and my experience with clients and companies I've worked for.

#### Round 6 (the second non-technical interview)

This was more of standard "tell me a time when" situational judgement questions.

### Notification of failure

Was by email about a week later:

<blockquote>
Dear Leader
 
Hope my email finds you well. I am coming back to you with a final decision for the Research Software Engineer, reporting into [team lead].   

It was incredibly hard to come to a conclusion, you have displayed a great profile and skills, but on this occasion we will not be able to offer you the role. That being said, if anything should come up in the future, we will let you know.  Meanwhile, it’s always a great idea to check Jobs in Research | Microsoft Careers for other open roles, as we always have opportunities which we post there. 
 
Thank you once again for your time, involvement and energy – we have enjoyed greatly knowing you better. 

Best wishes
</blockquote>

A request for feedback went nowhere.

### Takeaway

Frustrating. This was frustrating from the lack of documentation about this online (and no one I knew or asked knowing anything about the process either), to me having to navigate an interview originally designed for PhD graduates, to the (perceived) lack of interest in the work I did in the talk, to some of the awkward questions I had to handle, to the lack of feedback. In fact, if we go back to why this repository even exists, one reason is so that future people getting an interview wouldn't be as clueless and struggle as much as I did in the process. While I failed (as usual), if someone else uses this to get the role, it's my consolation prize. 

This is the second time I failed with Microsoft in the finals, and perhaps by coincidence, the recruiter handling this in both cases was the same.
